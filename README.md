- **AI**: Google Gemini API for clause analysis and rewriting
- **Processing**: Document AI OCR + Cloud DLP for privacy scanning
- **Features**: Real-time job polling, export reports, diff visualization

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Streamlit Web Application**: Single-page application with sidebar navigation for different workflow stages
- **Session State Management**: Maintains processed documents, risky clauses, selected clauses, and rewrite history across user interactions
- **Component-Based UI**: Modular interface with separate sections for document upload, risk analysis, clause rewriting, and export functionality

## Backend Architecture
- **Modular Processing Pipeline**: Separate utility classes handle distinct responsibilities:
  - `PDFProcessor`: Document parsing and text extraction using PyMuPDF
  - `RiskDetector`: Rule-based clause risk analysis with pattern matching
  - `ClauseRewriter`: AI-powered clause rewriting using Google Gemini API
  - `DiffGenerator`: HTML diff generation for comparing original vs. rewritten text
  - `ExportManager`: Report generation in HTML and PDF formats

## AI Integration
- **Google Gemini API**: Primary AI service for clause rewriting with structured JSON responses
- **Rule-Based Risk Detection**: Pattern matching system for identifying problematic clauses including auto-renewal, unilateral changes, short notice periods, high penalties, and exclusive jurisdiction clauses
- **Contextual Rewriting**: AI considers user-specified controls and generates rationale, fallback positions, and risk reduction explanations

## Data Processing
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) for reliable PDF parsing and page-by-page text extraction
- **Clause Identification**: Pattern-based clause detection using regex for common legal document structures
- **Risk Scoring**: Numerical risk assessment system with thresholds for different clause types
- **Diff Generation**: HTML-based visual comparison between original and rewritten clauses

## Export System
- **Multi-Format Reports**: Generates both HTML and PDF reports with comprehensive analysis
- **Visual Diff Integration**: Includes side-by-side comparisons with syntax highlighting
- **Structured Output**: Reports contain risk analysis, rewrite suggestions, and implementation recommendations

# External Dependencies

## AI Services
- **Google Gemini API**: Primary AI service for clause rewriting and analysis via `google.genai` client
- **Environment-Based Authentication**: Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable for API access

## Document Processing
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: PDF parsing and text extraction library for handling legal documents
- **Python-docx**: Microsoft Word document processing capabilities
- **PyPDF**: Additional PDF processing utilities

## Web Framework
- **Streamlit**: Primary web framework for building the interactive user interface
- **FastAPI/Uvicorn**: Backend API framework for potential service expansion

## Utility Libraries
- **difflib**: Built-in Python library for generating text differences and comparisons
- **base64**: Encoding utilities for file handling and data transfer
- **tempfile**: Temporary file management for document processing
- **re (regex)**: Pattern matching for clause identification and risk detection

## Data Handling
- **JSON**: Data serialization for API communication and session state management
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis capabilities for document statistics
- **HTML**: Custom HTML generation for reports and diff visualization

## Potential Cloud Integration
- **Google Cloud Services**: Architecture supports integration with Document AI, Cloud Storage, and AI Platform for enhanced processing capabilities
- **Cloud Logging**: Structured logging support for production deployment monitoring

# Quick Start

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 16+
- Google Gemini API Key (get it from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/))

## Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_jwt
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id (optional, for OCR/DLP)
```

## Installation & Running

### Backend (FastAPI)
```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Run the backend server
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Frontend (React)
```powershell
# In a new terminal, navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## First Time Setup

1. Register a new account at `http://localhost:3000/register`
2. Login with your credentials
3. Upload a contract document (PDF or image)
4. Review risk analysis and use the redline sandbox

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Or export the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
